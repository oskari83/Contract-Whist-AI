## Viikkoraportti 2

**Projektiin käytetty tuntimäärä**

+ 8 hours

**Mitä olen tehnyt tällä viikolla?**

I refactored and improved the Game class so that I can start coding the algorithm for the AI system next week.

I also had a 2-hour discussion with the course supervisor about the direction of my project with regards to the algorithm I am going to use and apply

Additionally I:
- added comments to my code,
- added pylint to check the syntax of the code
- added code coverage report (89% of Game class)
- added unit tests for the Game class

**Miten ohjelma on edistynyt?**

I have made good progress in the creation of the game-code, but I still have to implement functionality so that the game class can give the only legal next moves. Additionally, I have a good idea now of what exactly I will do with respect to the game AI algorithm through my discussion with the course supervisor.

**Mitä opin tällä viikolla / tänään?**

I learned how I can apply algorithms to my card game, and that I can possibly apply a monte carlo tree search and then run several simulations of cards dealt to come at an approximation of what the best next move might be.

**Mikä jäi epäselväksi tai tuottanut vaikeuksia? Vastaa tähän kohtaan rehellisesti, koska saat tarvittaessa apua tämän kohdan perusteella.**

It was really difficult to figure out how to approach the game AI algorithm so that it could give good results. But in the end, I found an article describing a method which I can apply to hopefully build a good AI system.

**Mitä teen seuraavaksi?**

Next week I will start coding the AI system. I will start by coding the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for a given hand of cards before progressing to the next simulation and averaging step.

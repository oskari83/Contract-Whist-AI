## Viikkoraportti 1

**Projektiin käytetty tuntimäärä**

+ 8 hours

**Mitä olen tehnyt tällä viikolla?**

I started the project this week by creating the repository and by starting to build a version of the card game that the AI can then play.

**Miten ohjelma on edistynyt?**

I have made good progress in the creation of the game-code, I still have to finish it up so that it counts total points and doesnt allow the breaking of rules or erroneous inputs, but otherwise the basic logic of the game is laid down and next week I can progress to actually starting the AI system.

**Mitä opin tällä viikolla / tänään?**

I did not learn much new this week, I spent a lot of time reading the course website and the course material which is most of the learning I did this week.

**Mikä jäi epäselväksi tai tuottanut vaikeuksia? Vastaa tähän kohtaan rehellisesti, koska saat tarvittaessa apua tämän kohdan perusteella.**

Nothing is unclear or has been difficult thus far, then again, I have not really started coding the hardest part of the project.

**Mitä teen seuraavaksi?**

Next week I will start coding the AI system, I will probably start by applying simpler methods such as a min-max algorithm to an AI that can cheat and knows everyone's cards and then move on to monte carlo methods once I feel like I have a good grasp of building AI systems.
